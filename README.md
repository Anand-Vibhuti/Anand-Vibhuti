## Projects
Here are some of the projects that I have worked on:

### Cryptocurrency Exchange:
Developed a centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange platform using C++ that allows users to buy and sell different cryptocurrencies. The platform features a user-friendly interface, real-time price updates, and secure transactions.
### DJ Mixer Application:
Created a DJ Mixer application using C++ and JUCE framework that allows users to mix and edit audio tracks in real-time. The application includes features such as beat matching, looping, and crossfading.
### Analysis of Indian Unicorn companies:
Utilized data science techniques like regression analysis and data visualization to analyze the growth and success of Indian Unicorn companies. The project involved collecting and cleaning large datasets, and using statistical methods to identify patterns and trends.
### Object identification for autonomous cars:
Developed a machine learning model to identify and track objects in real-time using OpenCV and Tensorflow. The model was trained on a dataset of images and tested on a live video feed, achieving high accuracy in object detection.
### Smart stick for visually impaired using IOT:
Developed a smart stick for visually impaired people using IOT that helps them navigate and detect obstacles in their surroundings. The stick uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and provides audio feedback to the user.
### Retro Game in p5.js:
Created a retro-style game using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. The game features 8-bit style graphics and sound effects, and allows players to control a character and collect points.
## Certification
